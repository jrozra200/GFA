## Lunch & Learn Information

**Description:** Data-savvy professionals are in high demand in businesses, 
public agencies, and nonprofits. The supply of professionals who can work 
effectively with data at scale is limited and is reflected by rapidly rising 
demand for data scientists and data analysts. This Lunch & Learn series explores 
how real-world data from a variety of disciplines are gathered, managed, and 
used for making decisions or predictions.
