directory.

# Something new - multiple datasets

Let's join some data in Tableau.

---

# Review of last session.

Let's create a few visualizations.

---

class: left, middle

# Plot One

1. Create a Line Chart - total hits per year
2. Change the axis to not include zero
3. Let's filter year - there's too many years!

---

class: left, middle

# Plot Two

3. Copy sheet and change it to a bar chart - total HR per year
4. Change the axis TO include zero

---

class: left, middle

# Plot Three

6. Copy sheet and include team as a color
7. Sort team by HR

---

class: center, middle

# I'm Curious, though... in 2021, what was the breakdown of hits per team?

Does anyone know any one-dimensional data graphics?

---

class: left, middle

# Plot Four

1. Add column as a row and select Histogram
2. Add a filter for 2021
3. Explain the distribution

# Turning the plots into a dashboard

Let's create our first dashboard using the charts we've created.

---

class: center, middle

# Turning the plots into a story board

Similar to a dashboard, but allows you to control the "story" and more naturally 
add corresponding text.

# Lying with Statistics

"Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to [then British Prime Minister, Benjamin] Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: 'There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.'" - Mark Twain, 1907
