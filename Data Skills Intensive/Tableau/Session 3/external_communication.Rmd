# Review of last session.

Let's recreate a few visualizations from last time (and maybe a new one). 

---

class: left, middle

# Plot One

1. Create a Line Chart
2. Change the axis to not include zero
3. Copy sheet and change it to a bar chart
4. Change the axis TO include zero
5. Change measure from continuous to discrete
6. Copy sheet and include state as a color
7. Sort state by population

# I'm Curious, though... in 2016, what was the breakdown of zip code population?

Does anyone know any one-dimensional data graphics?

---

class: left, middle

# Plot Two

1. Add column as a row and select Histogram
2. Add a filter for 2016
3. Explain the distribution
4. Change y axis to logarithmic

# Last for Today

Can you create a line chart of three zipcodes that are interesting to you? 
Show how the population has changed over time.

# Turning the plots into a dashboard

Let's create our first dashboard using the charts we've created.

---

class: center, middle

# Turning the plots into a story board

Similar to a dashboard, but allows you to control the "story" and more naturally 
add corresponding text.

# Lying with Statistics

"Figures often beguile me, particularly when I have the arranging of them myself; in which case the remark attributed to [then British Prime Minister, Benjamin] Disraeli would often apply with justice and force: 'There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.'" - Mark Twain, 1907
